# IoBuilders POC

This repository contains my thoughts and answers for the IoBuilderÂ´s selection process:

1. **Theoretical test** - A POC about a specific scenario in order to evaluate my knowledge on backend, frontend and blockchain.

2. **Technical test** - A development proposed based on my knowledge and answers to the theoretical test in order to evaluate my development skills.
